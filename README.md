# Bengali RAG QA API

This project provides a Bengali question-answering API built with FastAPI using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It integrates a vector database (ChromaDB), SBERT-based embeddings for Bengali, and Google Gemini via LangChain to generate answers from both MCQ and passage-based contexts.

---

## Features

- Retrieves relevant context from both MCQ and passage documents  
- Combines long-term memory (ChromaDB) and short-term history (chat memory)  
- Generates responses using Gemini 2.5 Flash via LangChain  
- API served with FastAPI and browsable via Swagger UI  
- Optional static frontend served via /conversation endpoint

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and enter the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LimonHalder/bengali-rag-qa-bot.git
cd bengali-rag-qa-bot
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up environment variable

> **Note:** For production, use proper environment variable management instead of hardcoding.

You can either set your API key inside main.py (not recommended for production):

```python
import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
```

Or export the environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key  # Linux/macOS
set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key     # Windows CMD
\$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # PowerShell
```

---

## Run the Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- Static frontend: http://127.0.0.1:8000/conversation

## Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate the RAG system using cosine similarity between embeddings from the **`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** model:

- **Groundedness Score:** Similarity between the generated answer and retrieved context embeddings, indicating how well the answer is supported.
- **Relevance Score:** Similarity between the query and retrieved context embeddings, indicating the relevance of the context.

### Code snippet

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

eval_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

answer_emb = eval_model.encode(answer, convert_to_tensor=True)
context_emb = eval_model.encode(" ".join(top_contexts), convert_to_tensor=True)
groundedness_score = util.cos_sim(answer_emb, context_emb).item()

query_emb = eval_model.encode(query, convert_to_tensor=True)
relevance_score = util.cos_sim(query_emb, context_emb).item()

```

### 1. What method or library did you use to extract the text, and why? Did you face any formatting challenges with the PDF content?

In the project, **PyMuPDF (fitz)** and **PyPDF2** libraries were used to extract divide the pdf into two section for passage and mcq. The OCR techniques (using **pytesseract** integrated "ben") are used from extract the text from the sectioned pdf and store in two different txt files (raw_data/passage_raw.txt and raw_data/mcq_raw.txt).
Yes, OCR can not proper extract mcq question's answer from the answer box(SL:ans pair of 100 mcq).

**Formatting challenges:**
PDF files often had inconsistent line breaks, embedded images, and mixed formatting which led to fragmented or broken sentences. Bengali-specific script complexities (like conjuncts and vowel signs) sometimes caused extraction artifacts.

Later i use a llm for processing the rextracted rwa text and  structuring output suitable for converting into vector embedding. Stored in process_data/section1.txt and process_data/section2.txt.

### 2. What chunking strategy did you choose (e.g. paragraph-based, sentence-based, character limit)? Why do you think it works well for semantic retrieval?

The chunking strategy employed is primarily **paragraph-based chunking combined with a character limit** (around 100-400 characters). Text was split at natural paragraph breaks (double newlines or explicit markers), then further segmented if too long.

Two way. One for passage type text, where i used chnk_size=400 with overlappinig=200.
another on is for formated mcq type text ,  where i used chunk_size=100, overlap=10.

**Why it works well:**
---

Different chunk sizes suit different text types: larger, overlapping chunks capture full context in long passages, improving relevance, while smaller chunks better isolate individual MCQs for precise retrieval. This balance ensures both accurate and efficient document retrieval.


---

### 3. What embedding model did you use? Why did you choose it? How does it capture the meaning of the text?

The project uses the **HuggingFace sentence-transformers model `l3cube-pune/bengali-sentence-similarity-sbert`** for generating embeddings.

**Reasons for choice:**

* It’s specifically fine-tuned for Bengali language semantics, improving representation quality over generic multilingual models.
* Usefull for bengali text doccument retrival.
* Also performed well for englisg and banlish query
* This helps capture meaning beyond keyword matching, encoding nuances of Bengali text including syntax and semantics.

---

### 4. How are you comparing the query with your stored chunks? Why did you choose this similarity method and storage setup?

**Similarity comparison:** The system uses **cosine similarity** between the query embedding and each document chunk embedding to find the most relevant chunks.

**Storage setup:** Embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB**, a vector database that supports fast similarity search and persistent storage.

**Why this method and setup:**

* Cosine similarity is widely adopted for embedding comparison due to its effectiveness in measuring semantic closeness independent of vector length.
* ChromaDB offers efficient indexing, scalable vector storage, and quick retrieval necessary for a responsive RAG system.
* This combination ensures retrieval of semantically relevant document chunks to feed into the LLM for answer generation.

---

### 5. How do you ensure that the question and the document chunks are compared meaningfully? What would happen if the query is vague or missing context?

**Ensuring meaningful comparison:**

* Both the query and document chunks are encoded using the same Bengali sentence-BERT model, ensuring consistent embedding space and semantic alignment.
* Paragraph-based chunking maintains coherent semantic units, avoiding fragmented or ambiguous embeddings.
* Retrieval uses top-k nearest neighbors to focus on the most semantically relevant chunks.

**If the query is vague or missing context:**

* The system may retrieve less relevant or overly broad chunks, leading to generic or off-topic answers.
* Lack of context reduces embedding precision, so similarity scores drop or the results become noisy.

---

### 6. Do the results seem relevant? If not, what might improve them (e.g. better chunking, better embedding model, larger document)?

The results from the current setup are reasonably relevant due to:

* Use of a Bengali-specific embedding model.
* Logical paragraph-based different chunking size that preserves semantic meaning for mcq type and passage type text.
* Efficient similarity search in a vector database.

**Potential improvements:**

* **Better chunking:** Using semantic segmentation or adaptive chunking that respects sentence boundaries or topical shifts.
* **Embedding models:** Fine-tuning the sentence-BERT model further on domain-specific data or experimenting with larger multilingual models like XLM-R or LaBSE for improved contextual understanding.
* **Corpus expansion:** Incorporating more comprehensive and diverse documents to enrich knowledge coverage.
* **Query enhancement:** Including query expansion or context enrichment to reduce ambiguity.
* **Re-ranking:** Applying a cross-encoder re-ranking step after retrieval to improve final answer relevance.
